Bayesian Independent Samples T-Test
===
The independent samples t-test allows the user to estimate the effect size and test the null hypothesis that the population means of two independent groups are equal.

### Assumptions
---

- Continuous dependent variable.
- The observations in both groups are a random sample from the population.
- The dependent variable is normally distributed in both populations.
- The population variances in the two groups are homogeneous.


### Input
---

#### Assignment Box
- Variables: In this box the dependent variable is selected.  
- Grouping Variable: In this box the variable defining the groups is selected.

#### Hypothesis
-  Group 1 &ne; Group 2 : Two-sided alternative hypothesis that the population means are equal.
-  Group 1 &gt; Group 2 : One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean of group one is larger than the population mean of group two.
-  Group 1 &lt; Group 2 : One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population mean of group one is smaller than the population mean of group two.

#### Bayes Factor
-  BF10 : Bayes factor to quantify evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis.
-  BF01 : Bayes factor to quantify evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the alternative hypothesis.
-  Log(BF10) : Natural logarithm of BF10.

#### Tests
- Student: Student's t-test. This option is selected by default.
- Mann-Whitney: Mann-Whitney test.
  - No. samples: The number of MCMC samples to use.

#### Additional Statistics
-  Descriptives : Sample size, sample mean, sample standard deviation, standard error of the mean for each group.

#### Missing Values
- Exclude cases per dependent variable: In case of multiple t-tests within a single analysis, each test will be conducted using all cases with valid data for the dependent variable for the particular t-test. Sample sizes may therefore vary across the multiple t-tests.
- Exclude cases listwise: In case of multiple t-tests within a single analysis, each t-test will be conducted using only cases with valid data for all dependent variables. Sample size is therefore constant across the multiple t-tests.

#### Repeatability
- Set seed: Gives the option to set a seed for your analysis. Setting a seed will exclude random processes influencing an analysis.

#### Plots
- Prior and posterior: Displays the prior and posterior distribution of the effect size under the alternative hypothesis.
  - Additional info: Adds the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; adds a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null vs. alternative hypothesis; adds the median and the 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution of the effect size.
- Bayes factor robustness check: Displays the Bayes factor as a function of the width of the Cauchy prior on effect size. The scale of the Cauchy prior is varied between 0 and 1.5, creating progressively more uninformative priors.
  - Additional info: Adds the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; adds a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null vs. alternative hypothesis; adds the median and the 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution of the effect size.
- Sequential analysis: Displays the development of the Bayes factor as the data come in using the user-defined prior.
  - Robustness check: Adds the results of the sequential analysis using the wide (scale=1) and ultrawide prior (scale=sqrt(2)).
- Descriptives plots
  - Credible interval: Display central credible intervals. Default is 95%.
- Raincloud plots: Displays the individual cases (colored dots), box plots, and densities for each group.
  - Horizontal display: Changes the orientation of the raincloud plot so that the x-axis represents the dependent variable and the y-axis the grouping variable.


### Prior
- Default:
  - Cauchy: Scale of the Cauchy prior distribution on the effect size under the alternative hypothesis; the default is 0.707.
- Informed:
  -  Cauchy: Scale and location.
  - Normal: Mean and standard deviation.
  - Student's t: Scale, Location and degrees of freedom (df).

### Output
---

#### Bayesian Independent Samples T-Test
- Bayes factor: If a one-sided test is requested:
  - BF+0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that group one > group two, relative to the null hypothesis.
  - BF-0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that group one < group two, relative to the null hypothesis.
  - BF0+: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis, relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that group one > group two.
  - BF0-: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis, relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that group one < group two.
- error %: The error of the Gaussian quadrature integration routine used for the computation of the Bayes factor.
- W: The test statistic of the Wilcoxon test. The two most common definitions correspond to the sum of the ranks of the first sample with the minimum value subtracted or not. JASP uses the definition with the subtraction (also used by R).
- Rhat: A measure of MCMC convergence for the Wilcoxon test. A ratio comparing the between- and within-chain variance of the MCMC estimates for the delta parameter. Values less than or equal to 1 indicate convergence.

#### Group Descriptives
- N: Sample size.
- Mean: Sample mean.
- SD: Sample standard deviation.
- SE: Standard error of the mean.

#### Plots
- Prior and posterior: Displays the prior (dashed line) and posterior (solid line) distribution of the effect size under the alternative hypothesis; the gray circles represent the height of the prior and the posterior density at effect size delta = 0. The horizontal solid line represents the width of the 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution.
  - Additional info: Displays the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; displays a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null vs. alternative hypothesis; displays the median and 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution.
- Bayes factor robustness check: Displays the Bayes factor as a function of the width of the Cauchy prior on effect size. The black circle represents the Bayes factor computed with a wide prior; the white circle represents the Bayes factor computed with an ultrawide prior; the gray circle represents the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior.
- Sequential analysis: Displays the development of the Bayes factor as a function of the number of observations (n) using the user-defined prior; displays the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; displays a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null vs. alternative hypothesis; displays the median and 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution; shows the decisiveness of the evidence in terms of Jeffreys' (1961) evidence categories.
  - Robustness check: Displays the development of the Bayes factor as a function of the number of data points (n) using the wide and ultrawide prior distribution. The black circle represents the Bayes factor computed with a wide prior distribution; the white circle represents the Bayes factor computed with an ultrawide prior distribution; the gray circle represents the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior distribution.
- Descriptives plots
  - Credible interval: Central credible interval. Default is 95%.
- Raincloud plots: Displays the individual cases (colored dots), box plots, and densities for each group. The x-axis and color represent the grouping variable, and the y-axis represents the dependent variable. Within the box plots, the bold black line shows the sample median, the hinges indicate the 25th and 75th quantile, and the whiskers point to 1.5 interquartile ranges beyond the hinges. Densities are estimated using a Gaussian kernel and the bandwidth is determined with the 'nrd0' method (Silverman, 1986).
